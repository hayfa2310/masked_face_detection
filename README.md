# faced_mask_detection

During this last year, humanity has faced the worldwide pandemic COVID-19 which has frozen global traffic and left us forced to adapt our way of life in order to cope with this
virus. Affecting the health and lives of masses, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Governments have called for strict measures to be followed in order to prevent the spread of disease. Face masks have been one of the primary protection mechanisms that has been deployed vigorously. Faced with this urgent need, detecting masked faces in work environments and public places in a most efficient possible way and in large numbers has become essential. 

According to these circumstances, the aim of this project is to identify whether the person on an image is wearing a face mask or not with the help of computer vision and deep learning. To accomplish this task, we proposed a deep learning based method using transfer learning on ResNet-50 to deal with the detection of the masked faces. We choose to work with Fastai. The data we used was extracted from a competition in Zindi.
